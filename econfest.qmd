## Data Reasoning in Digital World

Refuting nonsense based on data and techniques is more difficult to
refute than common media falsification

Our statistical tool based courses are mainly concerned on focuing
tecnique and very little focus on quantitative reason and logic,
therefore, even educated masses fail to spot bullshit and call it
bullshit.

Instead of following fake news and then finding ways out to deal with
it, its important that our institutions teach basic skills to savvy
media consumers, such as how to fact-check news articles to how pictures
can lie (New York Time Op-ed, Mark Geleotti).

Each of us talk bullshit and it has nothing to do with religious/less
religious.

Basic skills when one is talking bullshit vs Art of Critical Skill

## 

Bullshit : Not a new phenomenon but since millions of years even among
animals

Easy access to information has overloaded access

Paltering

# Falsehood flies and the truth comes limping after

## 

-   Ex-PM conspiracy by a powerful country
-   Damage done and truth emerged

Alberto Barndonlini in 2014, it states: *"The amount of energy need to
refule bullshit is an order of magnitufe bigger than \[that needed\] to
produce it."*

Satirist Jonathan Swift wrote in 1710 that *"that falsehood flies, and
truth comes limping after it."*

FD Roosevelts' secretary of state, Cordell Hull: *"A lies will gallop
halfway round the world before the truth has come to pull its breeches
on."*

Bullshit (Brandolini, Franelli and Swifts taken together)is i. bullshit
takes less work to create that to clean up. ii. takes less intelligence
to create than to clean up, and iii. spreads fafter than efforts to
clean it up.

## From Chopal/Baithak and Face the Nation to Facebook

Truth tellers have another advantage. Social media provides a fertilizer
for the rapid proliferation of distractions, misinformation, bullshit,
and fake news.

## No time but smartphone to spread bullshit

-   Positive: easy to fact check but why bullshit goes unchecked
-   Brother of printing press
-   Anything can be produced if one has personal computer and internet

**The inadequacy of the unvarnished truth"** - Mindless lists , quizes,
memes, and celebrity gossip that proliferate media might crowd out
careful analyses of the sort one sees in responsible media

-   Prior to internet, large publisers cared about content and quality

## Headlines for retention not for information

Algorithms make things even worse. They are not designed to keep you
informed but to keep you engaged.

Being careful is admirable but it does not sell ads. Social media is
fertile ground for disinformation.

Tech entrepreneur Jeff Hammerbacher (Allen Ginsberg) complained in 2011
that "The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make
people click ads. That sucks." Sophisticated ways to diverge our
attention from real issues.

## Misinformation and Disinformation

December 2016, a website called AWD News published a frightening
headline:

    “Israeli Defense Minister: If Pakistan Send Ground Troops to Syria on Any Pretext, We Will Destroy the Country With Nuclear Attack.” 

Story made a big headline and it named the wrong person as the Israeli
Defense Minister.

        Khawaja M Asif, then Pak Def Min via twitter responded “Israeli def min threatens nuclear retaliation presuming pak role in Syria against Daesh…Israel forgets Pakistan is a Nuclear state too.” 
        

## Think more share less

Social media: firehouse strategy, our trust in friends and institutions
erode. Gary Kasprov summarized this approach in a post on Twitter: "The
point of modern propaganda isn't only to misinform or push an agenda, It
is to exhaust your critical thinking, to annihilate truth."

## Basic Approaches for Protecting ourselves against misinformation

1.  Technology: AI technology to detect fake news
2.  Government regulations
3.  Most powerful approach is education. If we do a good job of
    educating people in mdeia literacy and critical thinking, the
    problem of misinformation and disinformation can be solved from the
    bottom up.

Due to internet bullshit spreads more easily in a massively networked,
click-driven social media world than in any previous social environment.

## The Nature of Bullshit

### Persuasive vs evasive

### Bullshit and Black Boxes

Cat people earn more than dog people ANCOVA, p-value

Biases, data representation, relevant to the problem

### Criminals and Machine Learning

# Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence

# CAUSALITY

"Forget about a baby boom - rising home prices appear to be causing many
would-be parents to think twice before expanding their family." Even the
headline suggests causality: "Another Adverse Effect of High Home
Prices: Fewer Babies."

Beer and Pitcher

"Where minimum wage is higher, poverty is lower." is not the same claim
as "If minimum wage were to increase, poverty would decrease." The first
reports a trend across cities: Those with higher minimum wage have lower
poverty rates. The second suggests how one might go about reducing
poverty in a particular city.

## Delayed Gratification and Common Causes

## Numbers and Nonsense

Math $2+2=4$ Eng $2+2\approx4$ Accountatn: "Before I put anything in
writing,"he says in a lower whisper, "what you want it to be?"

Data can never lie is dangerous perspective, planets story 8, then 9 and
now again 8

Summary statistics condense information but if inappropriate, it can be
misleading

Percentage not appropriate if negative numbers

# Selection Bia

# Friendship Paradox

# Berkson's Paradox

## 

        People who are in good health are more likely to participate in wellness program. Its not wellness program cause good health.
        

## The Hidden Cause of Murphy's Law

In portugal: 60% of families with children have only one child, but 60%
of children have siblings.
