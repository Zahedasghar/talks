## Myth : You need to be a coder or AI expert 


### [**Reality**]{.orange}

You [**don’t need to build AI models**]{.yellow} — you need to [**apply AI to solve real-world problems**.]{.yellow}

The key skill today isn’t coding or prompt engineering, but: 

- **Understanding who you help** 

- **Identifying a painful, valuable problem**  
- **Using AI to automate 80–90% of the heavy lifting**

--- 

### **Example**

🩺 **Doctors** use AI to draft patient summaries — no coding needed.  
🏛 **Parliamentary researchers** use AI to analyze documents & public opinion — without programming.

---

### **A word from Jensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA)**

> "Everyone is now a programmer. You just have to tell the computer what to do."

---

### **Takeaway**

In this new era, **problem-solvers** who think clearly and craft valuable offers hold the real advantage.
