## Myth: You need to be a coder or AI expert

### [**Reality**]{.orange}
You [**don't need to build AI models**]{.yellow} or be a data scientist.   
Instead, [**you need to be a problem-solver**]{.orange} who can [**apply AI to real-world challenges**]{.blue}.

The key skill for most of us today isn't coding or prompt engineering, but: 
- **Understanding who you help** 
- **Identifying a painful, valuable problem**  
- **Using AI to automate 80–90% of the heavy lifting**

## Real-World Applications

### **Examples**
- 🩺 **Doctors** use AI to draft patient summaries — no coding needed
- 🏛 **Parliamentary researchers** use AI to analyze documents & public opinion — without programming

### **A word from Jensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA)**
> "Everyone is now a programmer. You just have to tell the computer what to do."

### **Takeaway**
In this new era, **problem-solvers** who think clearly and craft valuable solutions hold the real advantage.

**Example:**  
A researcher uses ChatGPT to draft a **brief summarizing the economic impact of proposed tax reforms**, customized for both legislators and the press.

## Summarizing Bills & Committee Reports

- **Task:** Use NLP and AI summarization tools
- **Capabilities:** Extract key points, amendments, and policy impacts; speed up legislative analysis and briefing preparation
  
**Example:**  
An AI tool summarizes a **200-page infrastructure bill**, highlighting funding allocations, environmental implications, and changes from previous drafts for committee members.

## Pilot Project: AI-Powered Transcription Service

- **Current challenge**: Manual transcription is time-consuming and prone to errors
- **Proposed solution**: AI speech-to-text technology customized for Pakistani accents and vocabulary
- **Benefits**: 
  - 80% reduction in transcription time
  - Searchable digital archives
  - Improved accessibility
  - Freed staff resources for more complex tasks
- **Timeline**: 6-month pilot with phased implementation
