# Welcome

Thank you for the introduction.  
First time in Pohang—what a beautiful campus!

---

# What Is AI?

- **Intelligent machines** aim to **achieve objectives** reliably.  
- Rooted in philosophy & economics—what it means “to do the right thing.”

---

# Simple Examples

- **AlphaGo**: objective = win at Go  
- **Navigation apps**: objective = shortest route  
- **Automated corporations**: objective = maximize shareholder return  

---

# Artificial General Intelligence

- **AGI**: systems that learn high-quality behavior **as well as or better than humans** across any task.  

---

# Historical Eras of AI

1. **Birth (1956)**  
   - Dartmouth conference  
   - **Symbolic AI** & **perceptrons**  
2. **Engineering Era (1970–2010)**  
   - Logic, probability, statistics, optimization  
   - Expert systems → **AI Winter** (~1988–1998)  
3. **Renaissance (1990s–2010)**  
   - Mathematical depth ↑, commercial interest still low  

---

# Deep Learning Emerges (~2010)

- **Many-layer neural nets** (“deep”)  
- Breakthroughs in speech, vision, translation  
- Rise of **foundation models** on massive text corpora  

---

# Anatomy of an AI System

1. **Input** (keyboard, camera, sensors)  
2. **Core** (“the box”): logic? probabilistic model? deep net?  
3. **Output**: steering, text, speech, etc.  

---

# Probabilistic Programming

- Combines **probability theory** + **general-purpose code**  
- **Nuclear Test Monitoring** example:  
  - CTBT’s seismic network → raw data  
  - Encode wave‐propagation & noise models  
  - **20 minutes of code**, 3× more accurate than legacy pipelines  

---

# Deep Learning at Scale

- Fill the box with a **huge circuit** of trillions of connections  
- Tune via **stochastic gradient descent**  
- Requires **vast data** and compute  

---

# Breakthrough Applications

- **Protein Folding**: billions of structures predicted  
- **Scientific Simulation**: 100 000× speed-up in climate models  
- **Generative Design**: organic, lightweight wheelchair parts  
- **Adaptive Robotics**: dynamic warehouse bots  

---

# Automation & Employment

- Amazon’s warehouse robots → replace **over 1 million** workers  
- Raises issues of **re-skilling** and **social safety nets**

---

# Self-Driving Cars

- Cruise taxis in SF use **pre-built 3D maps**, not true perception  
- Failures:  
  - Drove into **wet cement** (unseen in training)  
  - Dragged a pedestrian ~50 m → operation suspended  

---

# AI in Healthcare

- 2011: hype over **skin-cancer apps**  
- 2018: FDA **removed** them for poor performance  
- Medicine demands **deep clinical expertise**, not just data fitting  

---

# AI for Education

- LLMs master **elementary curricula**  
- Potential to **double–triple** learning speed (uni by age 11)  
- Challenge: low **profitability** in ed-tech  

---

# Limits of Deep Learning

- **Linear-time circuits** → cannot solve NP-hard tasks feasibly  
- **Data hunger**: child learns “giraffe” from one drawing; AI needs millions  

---

# AlphaGo Revisited

- 2017: AlphaGo beats Ke Jie (rating 3800)  
- Program rating 5200 → superhuman  
- **9-stone handicap** match vs amateur (2300) → human wins 15 ×  
- Shows AI lacks **common-sense grouping**  

---

# Toward Safe, Beneficial AI

- **Assistance Games** framework:  
  1. AI’s objective = serve **human interests**  
  2. Remain **uncertain** about our goals → learn them  
  3. Incentivized to allow **shutdown**  
- Only two viable paths:  
  1. **Safe-by-design** AI  
  2. **No AI**  

---

# Closing Thoughts

- AI’s history: **symbolic → probabilistic → deep**  
- Frontier: **hybrid** methods for robust AGI  
- Safety by **design**, not patchwork fixes
