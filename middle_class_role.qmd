## What makes middle class important {background-color="`r clrs_lt[5]`"}

Middle class: - Is a precondition of stability in the social structures - Is a measure of mitigating inequality in a society - Is a key factor in forcing politicians and bureaucracy to make accountable

> Easterly(2001): Nations with a large middle class tend to grow faster.

-   This is universal phenomenon.
-   English middle class of 18th and 19th century
-   China and India middle class is a phenomenon of today

##  {background-color="`r clrs_lt[5]`"}

-   Collier (1999) : Middle class forms alliance with lower classes in order to demand an inclusive political system
-   Acemoglu (2003): Decisive voters in democracy are from middle class
-   Bannerjee (2007): middle class is a source of new entrenpreneurs and this class stresses on accumulation of human capital and savings

**Warning:** 
> Basur(2003) : If venues for channeling middle class human capital and savings not provided, then tendency towards consumption expenditure puts sustainability of growth in danger
