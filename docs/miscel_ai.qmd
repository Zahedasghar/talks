## [Workshop Overview]{.yellow}
This training program is designed to equip government officials with a comprehensive understanding of AI tools, focusing on their application in economic policy making. While the course will cover a broad range of general AI tools to enhance overall decision-making and analysis capabilities, the primary emphasis will be on specialized tools like Economics Expert, Fiscal Policy Advisor, and Policy Advisor. Additionally, the workshop will explore the transformative potential of Generative AI in the public service sector. Whether participants already have access to Generative AI tools or wish to explore the possibilities of using these technologies in their day-to-day roles, the workshop will provide an introduction to Generative AI and delve into its practical applications within public service. Attendees will engage in hands-on activities to address the critical question: "How might we use Generative AI in the Public Service?" Through this training, participants will gain the skills necessary to effectively integrate both traditional AI and Generative AI into their operations, optimizing their ability to formulate and implement sound economic policies. 

This condensed yet intensive workshop is designed to empower employees from key economic ministries with the knowledge and skills needed to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into economic planning and policy development. Participants will engage in hands-on training with AI tools and explore how these technologies can be utilized to enhance fiscal policy, economic analysis, and overall decision-making processes.

"**ChatGPT decreased the time required for work by 40%, even as outside evaluators rated the quality of work written with the help of AI to be 18% better than the ones done by humans alone. After using it, people were more worried about their jobs… but also significantly happier**" - Noy & Zhang (2023)

## DALL.E

It sounds like you’re asking how to use DALL·E, the tool that can create images from text descriptions. Here's a quick guide on how to use it:

1. **Describe Your Image**: Start by telling me what you want to see in an image. The more detailed your description, the better. Include things like the setting, characters, colors, mood, and any specific objects or actions.

   - Example: “A sunset over a calm ocean with a small sailboat on the horizon.”

2. **Choose the Image Size**: You can request different image sizes:
   - **1024x1024**: A square image, ideal for most cases.
   - **1792x1024**: A wide image, great for landscapes or scenes with a lot of horizontal detail.
   - **1024x1792**: A tall image, good for full-body portraits or vertical compositions.

3. **Request Modifications**: After I generate an image, you can ask for changes if you want something slightly different. Just describe what you’d like to modify.

4. **Specify the Number of Images**: By default, I’ll generate 2 images, but you can ask for just one if you prefer.

5. **Use in Conversations**: If you’re working on a project or just brainstorming ideas, you can ask for images that fit your concepts as part of a larger discussion.

That’s it! Let me know what you want to create, and I’ll help bring it to life.
