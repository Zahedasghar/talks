## [Myth : You need to be a coder or AI expert]{.yellow}} 


### Reality

You [**don‚Äôt need to build AI models**]{.yellow} or be a data scientist.   
Instead, [**you need to be a problem-solver**]{.yellow} who can [**apply AI to real-world challenges**]{.pink}.


The key skill for most of us today isn‚Äôt coding or prompt engineering, but: 

- **Understanding who you help** 

- **Identifying a painful, valuable problem**  
- **Using AI to automate 80‚Äì90% of the heavy lifting**

--- 

### **Example**

ü©∫ **Doctors** use AI to draft patient summaries ‚Äî no coding needed.  
üèõ **Parliamentary researchers** use AI to analyze documents & public opinion ‚Äî without programming.



### **A word from Jensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA)**

> "Everyone is now a programmer. You just have to tell the computer what to do."



### **Takeaway**

In this new era, **problem-solvers** who think clearly and craft valuable offers hold the real advantage.

# Practical Use Cases of AI in Parliamentary Research

---

### üìù Drafting Policy Briefs & Talking Points

- **Task:** Quickly generate drafts using Generative AI.
- **Capabilities:** Tailor content for different audiences (lawmakers, media, public). Maintain consistency and reduce writing time.
  
**Example:**  
A researcher uses ChatGPT to draft a **brief summarizing the economic impact of proposed tax reforms**, customized for both legislators and the press.

---

### üìÑ Summarizing Bills & Committee Reports

- **Task:** Use NLP and AI summarization tools.
- **Capabilities:** Extract key points, amendments, and policy impacts. Speed up legislative analysis and briefing preparation.
  
**Example:**  
An AI tool summarizes a **200-page infrastructure bill**, highlighting funding allocations, environmental implications, and changes from previous drafts for committee members.
