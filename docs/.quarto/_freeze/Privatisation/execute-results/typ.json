Why? Governance issues, lack of accountability, political interference, and corruption. \n\n- Debate on SOEs: privatization vs government shareholding. \n\n- Financial crisis demands a  reassessment of SOEs.  \n\n- **Privatisation** is considered a key tool for **restructuring** and **improving efficiency** of SOEs. (Assumption)\n\n\n## Arguments for Privatisation\n\n- Privatisation can reduce the **fiscal burden** on the government.\n\n- Privatisation can **improve efficiency** and **reduce losses** in SOEs. \n\n- Privatisation can **increase competition** and **improve service quality**. \n\n- Privatisation can **attract foreign investment** and **improve economic growth**. \n\n- Privatisation can **reduce corruption** and **improve transparency**. \n\n- Reduce burden on taxpayers \n\n## Arguments Against Privatisation\n\n- Privatisation can lead to **job losses** and **wage cuts**. \n\n- Privatisation can lead to **monopolies** and **higher prices**. \n- Privatisation can lead to **loss of control** over strategic sectors. \n\n- Privatisation can lead to **foreign ownership** and **capital flight**. \n\n- Privatisation can lead to **inequality** and **social unrest**.    \n\n## Key Principles of Privatisation \n\n\n- Efficiency & Profitability: The divestment should improve the operational efficiency of the enterprises.  \n\n- **Transparency and fair pricing**: The process should be transparent and open to public scrutiny. \n\n- **Competition**: The market should be competitive and open to new entrants. \n\n- **Regulation**: The sector should be regulated to prevent abuse of market power. \n\n- **Social Impact**: The social impact of privatisation should be carefully considered. \n\n- **Economic Impact**: The economic impact of privatisation should be carefully considered. \n\n- **Political Impact**: The political impact of privatisation should be carefully considered. \n\n- **Legal Framework**: The legal framework for privatisation should be clear and well-defined. \n\n- **Public Support**: There should be public support for privatisation. \n\n## No one size fits all approach \n\n- Privatisation should be tailored to the specific circumstances of each SOE. \n\n- Different SOEs may require different approaches to privatisation. \n\n- The goal of privatisation should be to improve the performance of SOEs, not just to raise revenue or reduce the fiscal deficit. \n\n- Privatisation should be part of a broader strategy to reform the public sector and improve governance. \n\n- Privatisation should be accompanied by measures to protect workers and consumers. \n\n\n## Privatisation of Transport Sector\n\n- Airports, airlines,  roads and railways are key components of the transport sector.\n\n- **PIA** : Rs. 70 to 80 billion losses annually on accounting books. Economic loses are much higher.\n\n\n## Privatisation of Power Sector\n\n- Power generation, transmission and distribution are key components of the power sector. \n\n- **Circular debt** is a major issue in the power sector. \n\n- DISCOs are **inefficient** and **loss-making**.\n\n- Each DISCO has its own set of problems and challenges.\n\n\n## Success stories of privatisation \n\n- **Karachi Electric**: Privatisation of K-Electric has improved efficiency and service quality. \n\n- **PTCL**: Privatisation of PTCL has attracted foreign investment and improved service quality. \n\n- **HBL**: Privatisation of HBL has attracted foreign investment and improved service quality. \n\n- **UBL**: Privatisation of UBL has attracted foreign investment and improved service quality. \n\nYouth got chance to be anchors, ceos and managers in open tv and telcos.\n\n\n\n## Example: Pakistan International Airlines & Pakistan Steel Mills\n- These SOEs are incurring huge losses.\n- Local and international competitors are more efficient.\n- Divestment or privatization should be prioritized.\n\n## Case of Pakistan Railways\n- Vital for both **passenger traffic and freight services**.\n- **Underinvestment** in Pakistan Railways.\n- Need for a model similar to the **aviation sector**:\n  - Government manages non-moving infrastructure.\n  - Private sector manages moving infrastructure.\n\n## Petroleum and Power Sectors\n- Monopoly status of SOEs in these sectors.\n- Profitability without benchmarking.\n- **Rs 3 trillion circular debt** in the power sector due to inefficient governance.\n- Need for market reforms before privatization in power distribution.\n\n## Lessons from Karachi Electric\n- Privatization alone does not solve all issues.\n- **Sectoral reforms** needed for private sector efficiency gains.\n\n## Need for Transparency\n- Listing SOEs on the **stock exchange** can improve governance and transparency.\n- Federal governmentâ€™s **P3A Act** for public-private partnerships.\n\n## Revisiting the Privatization Commission\n- Legal structure for privatization needs to be updated.\n- Need for **innovative divestment options** beyond traditional asset sales.\n\n## Conclusion: Broadening the Debate\n- Privatization debate should include:\n  - What and how to privatize.\n  - Efficient and transparent governance of SOEs.\n  - Specialized treatment for each SOE.\n\n[The Chaotic Pursuit of Privatisation of SOEs](https://www.dawn.com/news/1824841)\n\n## Introduction\n- Privatisation progress reported for **Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)** and outsourcing of three airports.\n- **Privatisation Commission** working on a three-phase strategy to privatise SOEs.\n- Focus on **loss-making SOEs** and reducing public sector involvement.\n\n## Financial Burden of SOEs\n> - SOEs incur annual losses of **Rs500 billion**.\n> - **Total accumulated losses** exceed Rs2.5 trillion (approx. **$9 billion**).\n- These losses pose a **systemic risk** to the financial sector.\n\n\n\n## IMF and Privatisation\n- **IMF bailout conditions** emphasize privatisation of PIA, Pakistan Steel Mills, RLNG power plants, and electricity distribution companies.\n- Privatisation is part of the **structural reforms** under the IMFâ€™s rescue loan package.\n\n## Investment Expectations\n- Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) expects over **$50 billion** investment from UAE and Saudi Arabia in five years.\n- So far, only a **fraction** of this investment has materialized in projects like Karachi Port.\n\n## Historic Context of Privatisation\n- Pakistan began privatising SOEs under the **IMFâ€™s Structural Adjustment Programme** in the 1980s.\n- Over the last three decades, privatisation has returned **Rs650 billion ($2.36 billion)** to the government.\n\n## Success Stories of Privatisation\n- **Banks, telecom industry, and electronic media** are often highlighted as successful examples of privatisation.\n- Privatisation has saved recurring losses and improved efficiency in certain sectors.\n\n## Cautions Against Hasty Privatisation\n- Experts like **Haroon Sharif** caution against rushing into privatisation without a clear rationale.\n- **World Bank** raises concerns about economic volatility, judicial activism, and trade union resistance as factors hindering successful privatisation.\n\n## Need for Regulatory Reforms\n- **Regulators need to be independent** and staffed with professionals to ensure competition and transparency.\n- **Transaction structure** should promote long-term economic prosperity, avoiding monopolies.\n\n## Risks of Monopolies\n- Privatization may shift **monopolies from public to private sector**.\n- Strong regulations are essential to prevent private sector monopolies from emerging after privatisation.\n\n## Conclusion\n- Privatisation requires extensive **reforms and transparency** to be successful.\n- Without these, the progress will remain chaotic and may cause more harm than good.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Real Estate\n\n| S# | Name of PSEs |\n|----|-------------------------------|\n| 1  | Services International Hotel, Lahore |\n| 2  | Jinnah Convention Centre, Islamabad |\n| 3  | PIA-IL (Roosevelt Hotel NY) |\n| 4  | Sale of Federal Government properties |\n\n# Aviation Sector\n\n| S# | Name of PSEs |\n|----|-------------------------------------|\n| 5  | Pakistan International Airlines Co.

These SOEs have long been a concern for the IMF and a drain on Pakistanâ€™s meager resources.\n\n## Current State of SOEs\n- **Circular debt**: Rs 2.7 trillion, despite repeated increases in electricity tariffs.\n- **Loans and guarantees**: Nearly Rs 6 trillion to sustain loss-making SOEs.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has prioritized the reform of these institutions. There is a need for a modern system and expert leadership on the boards of these institutions to enhance their performance.\n\n## New SOE Policy\nThe Ministry of Finance (MoF) has prepared a draft SOE policy to manage the fiscal risks. Key highlights of the policy:\n- **SOEs in Pakistan**: Around 200, engaged in various activities.\n- **Economic significance**: SOEs manage a significant share of Pakistan's infrastructure, communication, and utilities sectors.\n- **Factors for optimal performance**:\n  - Consistent overarching law for SOEs.\n  - Clear SOE ownership and reform policy.\n  - Commercial mandate and capable governance.\n  - Centralized SOE ownership monitoring.\n  - Strategic analysis and financial monitoring.\n  - Accountability and transparency.\n\n## Strategic SOEs\nThe draft policy identifies **strategic SOEs** that cannot be privatized due to their:\n- Strategic, security, or social importance.\n- Monopoly status without effective regulatory oversight.\n\n## Challenges and Reforms\nSuccessive governments have attempted SOE reforms, but with limited success. The key issues include:\n- **SOEs beyond restructuring**: SOEs like PIA and Pakistan Steel Mills need massive investments in technology and human resources.\n- **Political consequences**: Reforms often stall due to political considerations, despite the financial burden.\n\n\n\n\n## International Example: India\nIndia privatized its SOEs in the late 1990s. Key successes include:\n- **Defense sector**: Majority of defense production is now in the private sector.\n- **National carrier**: Air India was privatized and is being restructured by the Tata Group to compete globally.\n\n# Demands from Government\n\n## Key Demands\n\n- **An independent board**: The board should be independent of political influence.\n\n- **Forensic audit**: A forensic audit of SOEs should be conducted to identify the root causes of their financial distress in 3 months.\n\n- **Reform plan**: A reform plan should be prepared for each SOE within 6 months.\n\n## Advancements in Governance \n\n- **Technology, globalization, and management** have evolved.\n- Traditional governance models of SOEs are outdated. \n\n\n## Tailored Approach Needed \n\n- **No one-size-fits-all** approach for privatization.\n- Specialized treatment required for each SOE based on local and global circumstances.\n\n## Privatisation of elite clubs\n\n- **Privatization of elite clubs** like the Islamabad Club, Lahore Gymkhana, and Karachi Gymkhana can generate significant revenue. \n\n- **GORs**: Government Officers Residences (GORs) in prime locations can be sold for commercial purposes. \n\n- **Golf Courses**: Golf courses in prime locations can be privatized. \n\n- **State Guest Houses**: Punjab House, Sindh House ... land can be sold or leased for commercial purposes to hotels, shopping malls, etc.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nPrivatization is a widely debated concept. But what does it actually mean?\n\n# Public Infrastructure and Investments\n\n- Generations ago, America built:\n  - National highways\n  - Public colleges and universities\n  - Public schools, parks, libraries, research, etc.\n- Mid 1980, privatization was pushed to boost efficiency and reduce taxes.\n  \n> **Reality**: Privatization often boosts corporate profits instead.\n\n\n> **Question**: Are these services reaching where they are most needed?\n\n# The Role of Private Corporations\n\n- Private corporations can be efficient.\n- Some privatization has worked.\n  \n**BUT**: Their goal is to maximize **profit** for shareholders, not serve the **public interest**.\n\n# The Public Interest\n\nThe key question: **Whatâ€™s best for the public?**\n\nLetâ€™s consider 5 rules of thumb for when public services should not be privatized.\n\n---\n\n# 1. Community Services\n\n- Donâ€™t privatize when the service aims to bring communities together.\n- Example: The **Railways and Roads** serves even the most rural areas.\n- Privatization risks isolating marginalized groups.\n\n\n\n# 5. Lack of Competition\n\n- Donâ€™t privatize where thereâ€™s insufficient competition.\n- Example: **Defense contractors** face limited competition, leading to cost overruns.\n\n> Privatization without competition results in inefficiency.\n\n\n\n# The Public vs. Profit\n\n\n",
