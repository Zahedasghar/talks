Main focus will be on important tools like [Interactive Economic Policy Simulator]{.yellow}, [Fiscal Policy Advisor]{.yellow},  [Advanced Data Analysis]{.yellow} and [other AI tools]{.yellow}, with an overview of general AI tools to improve decision-making.\n\nThe workshop will also explain how Generative AI can help in public service. Whether participants already use Generative AI or want to learn, they will explore how it can be applied to their jobs. Through practical sessions, they will learn how to benefit from Generative AI to [boost productivity]{.yellow}, using it as a [trustable assistant]{.yellow}, [improve economic planning]{.yellow} and [policy-making]{.yellow}.\n\n## Key Learning Objectives\n\n1.  **Understanding AI , ML, NLP and Generative AI**\n\n3.  **Enhancing Efficiency with AI Tools**\n    \n4.  **Role-Based Learning and Practical Application**\n    \n## Schedule Overview\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Workshop Schedule\n\n| Item|Duration               |Activity                                                                                                            |Facilitator_Actions                                                                          |Output                                                                   |\n|----:|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|    1|9:30 - 9:45            |Welcome                                                                                                             |Introduction, set expectations, energize                                                     |Participants feel engaged and comfortable                                |\n|    2|9:45 - 11:00           |Introduction to Generative AI                                                                                       |Explain Gen AI, its evolution, use cases in public sector, engage participants with examples |Clear foundational understanding of Gen AI and its applications          |\n|    3|11:00 - 11:10          |Q&A Session                                                                                                         |Facilitate interactive Q&A session with clarifications                                       |Clarified doubts, participants' insights into Gen AI applications        |\n|    4|11:10 - 11:30          |Break                                                                                                               |N/A                                                                                          |N/A                                                                      |\n|    5|11:30 - 13:00          |Prompt Engineering, Basics of Prompts, Effective Prompt Writing                                                     |Present AI's use in economic analysis, hands-on prompt creation exercises                    |Practical understanding of AI-prompting in economic scenarios            |\n|    6|13:00 - 14:00 (60 min) |Lunch Break                                                                                                         |N/A                                                                                          |N/A                                                                      |\n|    7|14:00 - 15:30 (90 min) |AI special tools for Economic Policy Making (e.g Fiscal Policy Advisor), Data Analysis using AI (Excel, Python,...) |Demonstrate fiscal policy analysis with AI tools, hands-on data analysis                     |Hands-on experience with AI-driven data analysis and fiscal policy tools |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThis workshop will guide participants from foundational knowledge of Generative AI to practical applications in economics policy making, ensuring interactive and hands-on learning. ðŸ˜Š\n\n## Resources\n\nThis is a living list and some more resources will be added as we go along.\n\n-   [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwRdpYzPkkn302_rL5RrXvQE8j0jLP02j)\n\n-   [AI for Economists: Prompts & Resources](https://sites.google.com/view/lastunen/ai-for-economists)\n\n-   [Causal Inference Substack](https://causalinf.substack.com/)\n\n-   [One Useful Thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/)\n\n-   [Understanding AI](https://www.understandingai.org/)\n\n**Other AI sites:**\n\n-   [ChatPDF](https://www.chatpdf.com/)\n-   [Reeder AI](https://reeder.ai/)\n-   [Unriddle AI](https://app.unriddle.ai/)\n-   [Magic School AI](https://app.magicschool.ai/)\n",
