## Key Points

- Pakistan’s rapid population growth (1.89% p.a.) will strain job creation & poverty reduction.  
- Investing in **education**, **health**, and **female labor participation** can harness a demographic dividend.  
- **Urbanization** and **infrastructure** gaps must be addressed to maintain economic stability.  
- A **balanced** approach—family planning + growth policies—is the most promising path forward.

## Introduction

Pakistan’s economy and its population trajectory are tightly linked.  
Over the next 20 years, policies must manage a booming youth cohort while boosting jobs and incomes.

---

## Demographic Context

- **Population (2023):** 247 million  
- **Under-15 share:** 36% → high dependency ratio  
- **Working-age ratio:** < 60% vs ~66% regionally  
- **Urbanization:** 54% of Sindh; Karachi (18.9 m), Lahore (13 m)

---

## Economic Implications

- **Saving & Investment:** Depressed by high dependency  
- **Growth drag:** 1–1.5 p.p. annually over 25 years vs peers  
- **Poverty volatility:** 22–35% over two decades  
- **Fiscal pressure:** Energy shortages, debt servicing (> 9 tln Rs)

## Job Creation & Poverty

- **Sector focus:** Agri & textiles—low value added  
- **Female workforce:** +10 p.p. LFPR → +4–5% GDP  
- **Poverty headcount:** sensitive to growth shocks (floods, inflation)

3. **Female Empowerment**  
   - Remove barriers (transport, childcare), incentivize firms  
4. **Infrastructure & Urban Planning**  
   - Invest in power, transport, water for growing cities  
5. **International Support**  
   - Leverage remittances, concessional financing for social programs

## Primary Research Question

To what extent can a **simultaneous approach** to population management and inclusive economic growth serve as an optimal development strategy for Pakistan’s long-term stability and prosperity (2025–2045)?

---

## Secondary Questions: Population Dynamics Track

1. **Demographic Projections**  
   What are the projected demographic trends for Pakistan through 2045—fertility, age structure, urbanization—and how do they affect economic planning?  

2. **Cross-Country Lessons**  
   How effective have population management policies been in comparable developing economies, and what can Pakistan learn?  

3. **Historical Linkages**  
   What is the quantifiable relationship between past population growth rates and per capita economic indicators in Pakistan?

---

## Secondary Questions: Inclusive Economic Expansion Track

1. **Mechanisms of Inclusive Growth**  
   Which levers—employment generation, income distribution, sectoral diversification—matter most in Pakistan’s context?  

2. **Human Capital & Demographic Dividend**  
   How can Pakistan align education and skills policies to harness its youth bulge?  

3. **Institutional Enablers**  
   What role do governance, rule of law, and corruption indices play in enabling inclusive expansion?

## Secondary Questions: Integration & Synergy

- **Interaction Effects**  
  How do population management and growth strategies interact—complementary or conflicting?  

- **Sequencing & Timing**  
  What is the optimal order and timing for dual-track policy rollout?  

- **Balancing Short & Long Term**  
  How can Pakistan meet immediate needs while ensuring demographic sustainability?
