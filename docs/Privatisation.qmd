## Introduction

"The Case for Privatization of Pakistan’s State-owned Enterprises"
author: "Naveed Iftikhar"
- SOEs in Pakistan are underperforming.
- Debate on SOEs: privatization vs government shareholding.
- Financial crisis demands a reassessment of SOEs.

## Advancements in Governance
- **Technology, globalization, and management** have evolved.
- Traditional governance models of SOEs are outdated.
- Pakistan has around **200 SOEs** linked to the federal government, but only about **50 are of significance**.

## Sector Focus: Energy, Communication, Manufacturing
- SOEs in these sectors need substantial reforms.
- Many SOEs should be closed or liquidated.

## Tailored Approach Needed
- **No one-size-fits-all** approach for privatization.
- Specialized treatment required for each SOE based on local and global circumstances.

## Example: Pakistan International Airlines & Pakistan Steel Mills
- These SOEs are incurring huge losses.
- Local and international competitors are more efficient.
- Divestment or privatization should be prioritized.

## Case of Pakistan Railways
- Vital for both **passenger traffic and freight services**.
- **Underinvestment** in Pakistan Railways.
- Need for a model similar to the **aviation sector**:
  - Government manages non-moving infrastructure.
  - Private sector manages moving infrastructure.

## Petroleum and Power Sectors
- Monopoly status of SOEs in these sectors.
- Profitability without benchmarking.
- **Rs 3 trillion circular debt** in the power sector due to inefficient governance.
- Need for market reforms before privatization in power distribution.

## Lessons from Karachi Electric
- Privatization alone does not solve all issues.
- **Sectoral reforms** needed for private sector efficiency gains.

## Need for Transparency
- Listing SOEs on the **stock exchange** can improve governance and transparency.
- Federal government’s **P3A Act** for public-private partnerships.

## Revisiting the Privatization Commission
- Legal structure for privatization needs to be updated.
- Need for **innovative divestment options** beyond traditional asset sales.

## Conclusion: Broadening the Debate
- Privatization debate should include:
  - What and how to privatize.
  - Efficient and transparent governance of SOEs.
  - Specialized treatment for each SOE.

[The Chaotic Pursuit of Privatisation of SOEs](https://www.dawn.com/news/1824841)

## Introduction
- Privatisation progress reported for **Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)** and outsourcing of three airports.
- **Privatisation Commission** working on a three-phase strategy to privatise SOEs.
- Focus on **loss-making SOEs** and reducing public sector involvement.

## Financial Burden of SOEs
> - SOEs incur annual losses of **Rs500 billion**.
> - **Total accumulated losses** exceed Rs2.5 trillion (approx. **$9 billion**).
- These losses pose a **systemic risk** to the financial sector.

## SOE Profitability Trends
- **World Bank report**: Declining profitability of SOEs for over a decade.
- Profitability dropped from **0.8% of GDP in 2014** to **losses of 0.4% of GDP in 2020**.
- SOEs in Pakistan now have the lowest profitability in the South Asian region.

## IMF and Privatisation
- **IMF bailout conditions** emphasize privatisation of PIA, Pakistan Steel Mills, RLNG power plants, and electricity distribution companies.
- Privatisation is part of the **structural reforms** under the IMF’s rescue loan package.

## Investment Expectations
- Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) expects over **$50 billion** investment from UAE and Saudi Arabia in five years.
- So far, only a **fraction** of this investment has materialized in projects like Karachi Port.

## Historic Context of Privatisation
- Pakistan began privatising SOEs under the **IMF’s Structural Adjustment Programme** in the 1980s.
- Over the last three decades, privatisation has returned **Rs650 billion ($2.36 billion)** to the government.

## Success Stories of Privatisation
- **Banks, telecom industry, and electronic media** are often highlighted as successful examples of privatisation.
- Privatisation has saved recurring losses and improved efficiency in certain sectors.

## Cautions Against Hasty Privatisation
- Experts like **Haroon Sharif** caution against rushing into privatisation without a clear rationale.
- **World Bank** raises concerns about economic volatility, judicial activism, and trade union resistance as factors hindering successful privatisation.

## Need for Regulatory Reforms
- **Regulators need to be independent** and staffed with professionals to ensure competition and transparency.
- **Transaction structure** should promote long-term economic prosperity, avoiding monopolies.

## Risks of Monopolies
- Privatization may shift **monopolies from public to private sector**.
- Strong regulations are essential to prevent private sector monopolies from emerging after privatisation.

## Conclusion
- Privatisation requires extensive **reforms and transparency** to be successful.
- Without these, the progress will remain chaotic and may cause more harm than good.

# Issue with DISCOS privatisation

[DISCOS](https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2024/06/19/discos-is-there-a-way-out-of-the-existential-quagmire/) 


## Overview
- Distribution companies (DISCOs) face persistent financial losses.
- Current efforts focus on selling DISCOS to private investors.
- The central question: Will privatization alone solve the core issues?

## Key Challenges
- **Electricity theft** and **low recovery rates** are major challenges.
- Losses concentrated in remote areas and urban slums.
- Privatization may not directly address the root causes.

## Role of Privatization
- K Electric as a case study shows mixed results.
- A need to determine if Transmission & Distribution (T&D) can sustain private investment alone.

## Proposed Solutions
- Distributed generation (solar) for remote areas.
- Increased electricity sales to reduce underutilized capacity.
- Governance and accountability should be devolved to local levels.

## Conclusion
- Strong **policy reforms** and **strategic privatization** are necessary.
- Privatization must focus on **separating high loss/low recovery areas** and creating a **competitive electricity market**.







# [SOE Privatisation](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40253974/soes-privatisation-the-only-solution)

## Introduction
Driven by the current ‘four-point must list of IMF,’ Pakistan’s government is focusing on the settlement of loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs). These SOEs have long been a concern for the IMF and a drain on Pakistan’s meager resources.

## Current State of SOEs
- **Circular debt**: Rs 2.7 trillion, despite repeated increases in electricity tariffs.
- **Loans and guarantees**: Nearly Rs 6 trillion to sustain loss-making SOEs.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has prioritized the reform of these institutions. There is a need for a modern system and expert leadership on the boards of these institutions to enhance their performance.

## New SOE Policy
The Ministry of Finance (MoF) has prepared a draft SOE policy to manage the fiscal risks. Key highlights of the policy:
- **SOEs in Pakistan**: Around 200, engaged in various activities.
- **Economic significance**: SOEs manage a significant share of Pakistan's infrastructure, communication, and utilities sectors.
- **Factors for optimal performance**:
  - Consistent overarching law for SOEs.
  - Clear SOE ownership and reform policy.
  - Commercial mandate and capable governance.
  - Centralized SOE ownership monitoring.
  - Strategic analysis and financial monitoring.
  - Accountability and transparency.

## Strategic SOEs
The draft policy identifies **strategic SOEs** that cannot be privatized due to their:
- Strategic, security, or social importance.
- Monopoly status without effective regulatory oversight.

## Challenges and Reforms
Successive governments have attempted SOE reforms, but with limited success. The key issues include:
- **SOEs beyond restructuring**: SOEs like PIA and Pakistan Steel Mills need massive investments in technology and human resources.
- **Political consequences**: Reforms often stall due to political considerations, despite the financial burden.

## Privatization as the Solution
A sustainable solution is the **outright privatization** of ailing SOEs. Benefits include:
- **Revenue generation**: Privatization will generate revenue for the government.
- **Arresting public money drain**: It will stop the ongoing financial loss from inefficient SOEs.

## Past Privatization Efforts
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government made progress in SOE privatization between 2013-2018, especially with power distribution companies. However, the process was halted due to political reasons.

## International Example: India
India privatized its SOEs in the late 1990s. Key successes include:
- **Defense sector**: Majority of defense production is now in the private sector.
- **National carrier**: Air India was privatized and is being restructured by the Tata Group to compete globally.

## Conclusion
Pakistan stands at a crossroads. Outright privatization is the only viable solution to address the financial burden of loss-making SOEs and ensure sustainable economic growth.
