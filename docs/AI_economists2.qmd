## LLMs in Economics {.scrollable}

The advent of large language models (LLMs) that automate a plethora of cognitive tasks presents a significant paradigm shift that academic [economists should be cognizant of, given the cognitive nature of our work, which includes tasks such as data analysis, economic forecasting, and policy recommendation]{.yellow}. The rapid advancements in language models could potentially disrupt our profession, necessitating a proactive approach to this emerging technology.

In the short term, these models can [augment our productivity by automating routine tasks]{.yellow}, thereby allowing us to focus on more complex and nuanced aspects of economic research. However, [in the long run]{.yellow}, there is a substantial likelihood that these models could displace human economists, as they become increasingly adept at performing complex cognitive tasks. Consequently, it is incumbent upon us to prepare for this eventuality. This could involve developing a deeper understanding of these models to leverage their capabilities effectively, [diversifying our skill sets to include areas not easily automated,]{.yellow} and advocating for policies that ensure a just transition for those potentially displaced by these technological advancements.
