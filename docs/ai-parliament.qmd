## What is AI?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**

-   The broad concept where machines simulate human intelligence.

-   AI allows machines to perform tasks like decision-making, speech recognition, and problem-solving.

**Examples:**

- Medical Diagnosis Systems, Recommendation Engines, 
  Autonomous Vehicles, Virtual Assistants like Siri or Alexa and Chatbots.

::: notes
Medical Diagnosis Systems: AI algorithms analyze medical images (e.g., X-rays or MRIs) to detect diseases like cancer with high accuracy, assisting doctors in early diagnosis.
Recommendation Engines: Platforms like Netflix or Spotify use AI to analyze user preferences and suggest personalized movies, shows, or music.
Chatbots with Contextual Understanding: Advanced AI chatbots, like customer service bots on e-commerce sites, understand and respond to user queries in natural language, resolving issues or guiding purchases.
Autonomous Drones: AI-powered drones navigate environments, avoid obstacles, and perform tasks like package delivery or aerial mapping in real-time.

**Key Concepts**: 

  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
  
  - Machine Learning 
  
  - Generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) 
  
- Real-world examples across sectors 

- **Why AI now?** 

  - Advances in compute power, data, algorithms

**Machine Learning (ML)**:   A subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data and improve performance over time. 

-   ML doesn’t require explicit programming for each task. 

**Types of ML:**

-   Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data.
-   Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
-   Reinforcement Learning: Learns through rewards and penalties.

**Examples:** - Netflix recommendation system - Spam filters in email

--- 

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

-   A branch of AI focused on the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages.

-   Helps machines understand, interpret, and respond to human language.

**Applications:** - Sentiment analysis (understanding opinions) - Chatbots and language translation tools

**Examples:** - Google Translate - Virtual Assistants

## Generative AI

-   A form of AI that creates new content—whether it’s text, images, music, or other media—by learning from patterns in existing data.

-   Uses deep learning models such as transformers (like GPT) and GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks).

**Examples:** - GPT-4o for text generation - DALL-E for creating images from text descriptions - AI-generated music or art

## Traditional AI vs. Generative AI {.scrollable}

**Traditional AI**

-   Analyzes existing data to uncover patterns, trends, or insights.

**Purpose:**\
- Understand and summarize what’s already there.

**Techniques:** 
- Statistical analysis, clustering, classification.

**Examples:** 
- Business reports summarizing sales performance. 
- Tools like Google Analytics offering insights based on historical data.

## Generative AI {.scrollable}

- Focuses on creating new content by learning from existing patterns.

**Purpose:**\
- To generate something new—whether it's text, art, or even videos.

**Techniques:** - Deep learning models, transformers.

**Examples:** 
MidJourney generating artwork 

Stable Diffusion creating images 

Runway ML producing videos 

MusicLM composing songs 

Jukebox generating music tracks 

Copilot writing code 

Claude drafting text 
- ChatGPT generating human-like text responses.
VALL-E synthesizing speech  

- DALL-E creating images from text prompts.

## Key Takeaway 

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the broad field enabling machines to mimic human intelligence.
- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a technique within AI, focused on learning from data.
- **NLP** allows AI to understand and interact with human language.
- **Generative AI** creates new, original content based on learned patterns.
- **Traditional AI** analyzes existing data to provide insights, while **Generative AI** creates something entirely new.




## Myth : You need to be a coder or AI expert


[**Reality**]{.hi-orange}

You [**don’t need to build AI models**]{.yellow} or be a data scientist.   
Instead, [**you need to be a problem-solver**]{.yellow} who can [**apply AI to real-world challenges**]{.pink}.


The key skill for most of us today isn’t coding or prompt engineering, but: 

- **Understanding who you help** 

- **Identifying a painful, valuable problem**  
- **Using AI to automate 80–90% of the heavy lifting**
