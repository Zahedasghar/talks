## What is AI?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):** 

- The broad concept where machines simulate human intelligence. 

- AI allows machines to perform tasks like decision-making, speech recognition, and problem-solving.

**Examples:** 

- Self-driving cars
- Virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa



## What is Machine Learning (ML)?

**Machine Learning (ML):** 

- A subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data and improve performance over time. 

- ML doesn’t require explicit programming for each task. 


**Types of ML:** 

- Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data.
- Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
- Reinforcement Learning: Learns through rewards and penalties.

**Examples:**
- Netflix recommendation system
- Spam filters in email



## What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):** 

- A branch of AI focused on the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages.  

- Helps machines understand, interpret, and respond to human language.

**Applications:**
- Sentiment analysis (understanding opinions)
- Chatbots and language translation tools

**Examples:**
- Google Translate
- Virtual Assistants



## Generative AI

**Generative AI:** 

- A form of AI that creates new content—whether it’s text, images, music, or other media—by learning from patterns in existing data. 

- Uses deep learning models such as transformers (like GPT) and GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). 


**Examples:**
- GPT-4o for text generation
- DALL-E for creating images from text descriptions
- AI-generated music or art



## Traditional AI vs. Generative AI {.scrollable}


### Traditional AI

**Definition:** 

- Analyzes existing data to uncover patterns, trends, or insights.

**Purpose:**  
- Understand and summarize what’s already there.

**Techniques:**
- Statistical analysis, clustering, classification.

**Examples:**
- Business reports summarizing sales performance.
- Tools like Google Analytics offering insights based on historical data.


## Generative AI {.scrollable}

**Definition:**  
- Focuses on creating new content by learning from existing patterns.

**Purpose:**  
- To generate something new—whether it's text, art, or even videos.

**Techniques:**
- Deep learning models,  transformers.

**Examples:**
- GPT generating essays, DALL-E creating new images, AI composing music.

## What will Iqbal say to youth about use of Social Media {background-color="#002746"}

::: {.scrollable style="max-height: 500px; overflow-y: auto;"}
Allama Iqbal, known for his deep reflections on spirituality, selfhood (*Khudi*), and societal progress, would likely have a nuanced view of social media's impact on youth. Here's what he might say:

**1. Distraction from Purpose:**\
Iqbal would likely be concerned about social media's ability to distract youth from their true purpose. He often emphasized the need for deep self-reflection and personal growth, and he might view the constant scrolling and superficial interactions on social media as hindrances to achieving *Khudi*. He might say, [***"The pursuit of likes and followers should not replace the pursuit of self-realization and greater goals."***]{.yellow}

**2. Lost Sense of Identity:**\
Iqbal believed in the importance of individual and cultural identity. He might see social media as contributing to a loss of self, where youth are too often influenced by external validation and trends rather than their inner values and cultural heritage. He could warn that [***"In a world of filters and illusions, do not lose your true self. Your identity is not what others see online, but what you discover within."***]{.yellow}

**3. Potential for Positive Change:**\
Despite his concerns, Iqbal would recognize the potential of social media as a powerful tool for positive change. He might encourage the youth to use these platforms to raise awareness about important issues, foster meaningful connections, and promote justice and knowledge. He could say, [***"Use your voice on these platforms as a means to awaken and uplift, not just to entertain."***]{.yellow}

**4. Spiritual and Intellectual Balance:**\
Iqbal would likely urge the youth to balance their time on social media with activities that promote intellectual growth and spiritual reflection. He might remind them that while social media can be a tool for learning and connection, it should not replace the deeper, more personal journey of seeking knowledge and spiritual fulfillment. He might caution, [***"Do not let fleeting moments of entertainment steal the time meant for the pursuit of wisdom and self-enlightenment."***]{.yellow}

**5. The Power of Influence:**\
Iqbal would be keenly aware of social media's power to influence minds. He would advise youth to be discerning in their consumption of content, warning them not to fall prey to misinformation or hollow trends. He might say, [***"Just as a gardener tends to what he plants, so too must you guard your mind from the weeds of falsehood and idle talk."***]{.yellow}

In summary, Iqbal would likely see both the dangers and the opportunities in social media. He would call on the youth to use these platforms wisely, ensuring they foster self-growth, preserve cultural identity, and contribute meaningfully to society, rather than getting lost in the distractions of the digital world.

### Race between Education and Technology

![](images/AI/race_tech_edu.png){.r-stretch}

::: notes
Many a times technology races ahead of education. This leads to social pain and inequality. The whole educational system has to revolutionize to keep up. Well, our world has always been in a race between technology and education. Usually, these two go hand in hand, but there are some points in history where technology races so far ahead that education can barely keep pace.
:::

### The Role of AI in Idea Generation

-   AI can assist in generating ideas, refining questions, and clarifying thought processes.

-   Humans still need to iterate and prototype, but AI can generate a high volume of ideas, which humans often struggle with.

> #### The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas. Humans will need to continue the process of prototyping, testing, and iterating, but humans consistently struggle to produce large quantities of different and new ideas.'

### Comming Wave & Jobs

::: incremental
-   

    #### "AI offers vast tools for augmenting workers and enhancing work. We must master these tools and make them work for us." David Autor

-   

    ##### As per David Autor, the problem is that older models assumed technology " might raise some boats more than others, but would'nt lower any boats. However, as digital technology transformed the globaly economy there was "lots of evidence people were made worse off."
:::

::: notes
Let me give you a quick historical example. In the 15th century, technology raced ahead as a great piece of technology was invented: the printing press, which allowed books to be printed much cheaper than ever before. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of the population knew how to read, leading to massive social conflicts and inequality. Ultimately, the whole educational system had to revolutionize to keep up. This led to the birth of the first universities and schools.
