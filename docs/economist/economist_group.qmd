[Economic policymaking is a multifaceted process that shapes a countryâ€™s economic direction, and it is vital that those policies are effective for the well-being of a nation and its citizens. These include things like setting interest rates, domestic resource mobilisation, economic forecasting, or targeting subsidies.]{.yellow}


This training is for government officials, specially designed for economists, to learn about AI tools for economic policy making. Main focus will be on important tools like [Interactive Economic Policy Simulator]{.yellow}, [Fiscal Policy Advisor]{.yellow},  [Advanced Data Analysis]{.yellow} and [other AI tools]{.yellow}, with an overview of general AI tools to improve decision-making.

The workshop will also explain how Generative AI can help in public service. Whether participants already use Generative AI or want to learn, they will explore how it can be applied to their jobs. Through practical sessions, they will learn how to benefit from Generative AI to [boost productivity]{.yellow}, using it as a [trustable assistant]{.yellow}, [improve economic planning]{.yellow} and [policy-making]{.yellow}.

## Key Learning Objectives

1.  **Understanding AI , ML, NLP and Generative AI**

3.  **Enhancing Efficiency with AI Tools**
    
4.  **Role-Based Learning and Practical Application**
