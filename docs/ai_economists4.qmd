[**Zahid Asghar**]{.orange}






## Overview of Macroeconomic Data
  
  **Key Indicators:**
  
- GDP (constant and nominal)
- GDP growth
- Inflation (CPI)
- Exchange rates
- Fiscal balance
- Government expenditure

**Prompt:** What are the key macroeconomic indicators in this dataset that are crucial for policy analysis?
  
---
  
##  GDP Growth and Trends
  
  **Prompt:** How has GDP growth fluctuated over time, and what are the underlying factors behind these changes?
  
  - Use time-series analysis to observe growth.
- Key visualization: line plot of GDP growth over time.

### Load packages and data

```{r}
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("corrected_pakistan_economic_data.csv")

colnames(data)
```
**Convert year to year by removing FY**

```{r}
data$year <- gsub("FY", "", data$year)
```

---
  
### Inflation and Exchange Rates
  
  **Prompt:** What is the relationship between inflation (CPI) and exchange rate movements over the years?
  
  - Analyze correlation between inflation and exchange rates.
- Key visualization: scatter plot or line chart of both variables over time.

```{r}
# Inflation vs. Exchange Rate analysis (example code)
# Calculate inflation rate 


ggplot(data, aes(x=year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=cpi), color="blue") +
  geom_line(aes(y=exchange_rate), color="red") +
  labs(title="Inflation vs Exchange Rates", y="Value", x="Year")
```

## Slide 4: Fiscal Policy Insights
  
  **Prompt:** How does fiscal deficit influence economic stability? How has the fiscal balance changed over time?
  
  - Discuss fiscal balance as % of GDP.
- Key visual: bar chart showing fiscal balance over time.

---
  
## Slide 5: Government Expenditure and Growth
  
  **Prompt:** What role does government spending play in economic growth?
  
  - Compare government expenditure with GDP growth.
- Key visualization: line plots showing expenditure and growth side by side.

---
  
  # Slide 6: Private Investment Trends
  
  **Prompt:** How have private sector investments evolved, and what economic factors influence these trends?
  
  - Focus on GFCF data and analyze private investments.
- Key visualization: bar chart of investment trends over time.

---
  
  # Slide 7: External Sector and Oil Prices
  
  **Prompt:** How do fluctuations in oil prices affect economic performance?
  
  - Correlate oil price movements with GDP, inflation.
- Key visual: scatter plot or line chart of oil prices and macro indicators.

---
  
  # Slide 8: Public Debt and Economic Growth
  
  **Prompt:** Is there a relationship between public debt and economic growth?
  
  - Study public debt in relation to GDP growth.
- Key visual: a line plot comparing debt and GDP growth trends.

---
  
  # Slide 9: Policy Impact on Growth and Inflation
  
  **Prompt:** How have major policy shifts impacted inflation and economic growth?
  
  - Analyze historical data on inflation and growth around policy changes.
- Key visualization: annotated line chart.

---
  
  # Slide 10: Recommendations for Policy Action
  
  **Prompt:** What policy recommendations can be drawn from the data to address current economic challenges?
  
  - Summarize insights and propose recommendations.
- Encourage participants to use findings from previous slides for policy suggestions.

This template structure in Quarto will guide participants through each slide, blending prompts with R code for generating relevant visualizations and analyses. You can expand this by adding specific datasets, fine-tuning the visualizations based on your data, or introducing more complex analyses like regression or forecasting where needed.

Let me know if you'd like more specific R code for any of the slides or have further questions on generating charts!
