## [Workshop Overview]{.yellow}
This training program is designed to equip government officials with a comprehensive understanding of AI tools, focusing on their application in economic policy making. While the course will cover a broad range of general AI tools to enhance overall decision-making and analysis capabilities, the primary emphasis will be on specialized tools like [Economics Expert]{.yellow}, [Fiscal Policy Advisor]{.blue}, and [Policy Advisor]{.yellow}. Additionally, the workshop will explore the transformative potential of Generative AI in the public service sector. Whether participants already have access to Generative AI tools or wish to explore the possibilities of using these technologies in their day-to-day roles, the workshop will provide an introduction to Generative AI and delve into its practical applications within public service. Attendees will engage in hands-on activities to address the critical question: "How might we use Generative AI in the Public Service?" Through this training, participants will gain the skills necessary to effectively integrate both traditional AI and Generative AI into their operations, optimizing their ability to formulate and implement sound economic policies. 

This condensed yet intensive workshop is designed to empower employees from key economic ministries with the knowledge and skills needed to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into economic planning and policy development. Participants will engage in hands-on training with AI tools and explore how these technologies can be utilized to enhance fiscal policy, economic analysis, and overall decision-making processes.
