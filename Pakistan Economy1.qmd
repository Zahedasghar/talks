## Economic Challenges and Way Forward

### Zahid Asghar, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad

# .orange\[ Productivity and Trade Gap\]


>Large trade deficit after having current account surplus of \$424 million in July last year. Pakistan has gone through this boom and bust cycles many times before: an import-driven boom, balance of payments crisis, International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout, stabilisation, a period of growth and then back to a crisis. This time is no different.

## Economic Challenges

### Decades long struggle with macroeconomic stabilization arising from unsustainable fiscal policies

### Low Economic Growth, Compounding

### Heightened expectations of the population for a better life from democratic government

### Legacy of economic distortions

### Low and declining economic productivity

### Large loss-making public sector that impedes market development

## Macroeconomic Challenges

### Unemployment

### Inflation

### Growth dilema

### Stagnant Export

### NFC

Devolution is good with responsibility but NFC More resources to provinces but w/o liability of raising revenue

## Economic History

### China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia

### 1960 : Pakistan Better than others (23-24% rich in terms of GDP/capita)

### Lags Behind in

### - 1970s: 18%

### - 1980s : 7%

### - 1990s: 34 %

### - 2000s: 20%


## What is wrong

### Pakistan economy crashes every once in a while: feature by design

#### Very low investment rate

| Country          | Private Investment (%of GDP) |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Pakistan         | 10%                          |
| Bangladesh/India | 20-25%                       |

#### Fiscal problem: For every USD govt raises in revenue, it has to spend 2.7 USD

#### Income 1000 USD, spending 2700 USD, Balance of Payment: X=1000, M=2750 USD

#### Sins: SOEs, Rent Seeking, pensions

#### If no borrowing, country to shut down

#### Liquidity Problem: Short maturity term on average 1 to 2 years

## Flawed Economic Discourse 
### Pipedreams: SEZs, Roads, Corridors, Gas pipelines 

### Stuck: hardcore paradigm of development 

### Reality: Software is primary requirement
####   Loss of sovereignty due to economic situation international and financial

## [CAD: A cause for concern](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40128736)

### Major components of current account deficit

-   

    ### Trade

-   

    ### Remittances and

-   

    ### financial accounts

    #### Unsustainable CAD has been the main reason for Pakistan's 23rd entry into the IMF program.

-   

    ### fuel and edible oil cost 1/3rd of total import bill

??? WB reports that South Asia will grow at 3.4 % over the three year period. India will grow at 8.4 % while Pakistan at 3.4 %. Pakistan is lagging behind and clubbed together with Afghanistan where 30-35% people are not ready for vaccination.

> Two immediate recommendations: - Reduction in current account deficit - expansion in exports

## Bangladesh achieved a lot by boosting its export and even Bhutan did well by attracting tourism. We had long fiscal challenges and even cant affort now to put more burden on people by increasing energy prices.

> ## .pink\[Economic theory dictates that if a CAD is being financed by borrowing, with associated costs, it will become unsustainable and today the rise in domestic and foreign debt has crossed all previous records. In addition, loss of currency from Rs.152 to Rs.187 rupees to the dollar would raise the risk of capital flight as there will be loss of faith in the value of currency by both foreign and residents.\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What the problem is?

As there is `r emo::ji("arrow_up")`growth `r emo::ji("arrow_right")`CAD `r emo::ji("arrow_up")`

#### 18-20 billion USD: Large amount for Pakistan Economy size

#### CAD increase implies pressure on ER which causes import cost to increase

#### CAD leads to interest rate increase which leads to domestic economy to contract to address CAD

-   

    #### 4/5 year ago: same situation , CAD=20 billion USD

-   

    #### Economy has to contract , its recurrence

-   

    #### This chronic issue of BOP causing Pakistan not to grow

---
### Sustained Flawed Policies
- ####  Zardari : Costly energy deals beneficials to sellers
- ####  Nawaz Sharif: Power generation plants on same TORs as Zardari
- ####  Imran Khan : Failure to import RLNG on time
- ####  Unsustainable circular debt: Rs. 1.2 trillion in 2018 before PTI government & now 2.4 trillion Rs 
- #### Little room to play : Debt, Defence, Pension, Government Expenditure, with ex-PM focus for more resources to Kamyab Jawan and Ehsas program.

- #### Succesive governments fulfilled their commitment of shifting the burden to consumers but never fulfills its commitment of deep structural reforms 
???
 The sustained flawed policies over decades of postponing the hour of reckoning have not only made the donors reluctant to accept pledges for meaningful non-reversible reforms, a situation exacerbated by lack of US support on their boards, but also due to the presentation of half-truths to the executive which prevents meaningful reforms.
---

## IMF and Pakistan

-   

    #### 22 programs

-   

    #### 23rd Shaukat Tarin : different from his 2008 expectations due to low engagement of Pakistan with US

-   

    #### a) Implementation of harsh conditions

-   

    #### b) Focus on raising revenue

-   

    #### c) 28.5 billion dollar funding is a condition of 39 month ongoing program or in other words roll-over of loans by `friendly` countries mainly China and Saudi Arabia till Sep-2022.

???

a)  

    -   In almost all 22 IMF programs, govts never made any progress in any challenging reform(s) and all govts shifted the onus of achieving full cost of recovery on to the consumers by raising tariff.

-   Circular debt 1.2 trillion in 2018 to 2.2 trillion rupees today (Nov.2021)

b)  

    -   Given current scenario, only indirect taxes leading to more burden on poor than rich. Instead of slashing expenditure, Tarin increased current expenditure significantly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why repeated problem of BOP

-   

    #### Pak Import=2\*X, remittances \$25b

-   

    #### Import demandd but nothing to generate to sell

-   

    #### low productivity

-   

    #### Elite Capture: Everywhere but engaged in productive activities: China, Japan (in the past) and export oriented

### Twin problem: Elite capture and also of bad quality

??? Atif Mian Pakistan has fundamentally unsustainable model Business to make money= Real Estate money increase due to appreciation of land but unproductive side for GDP -Land: Rent seeking When lot of value is generated through a non productive sector, it generates demand which leads to increase in goods and services impying to more import\[oil, cars, other Goods and Services\] - Are these individuals producing something to be sold in international market? IT, car manufacturing.... Value generation: unproductive -Sugar industry value generation leads to demand but not for the rest of the world

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Export Matters

-   global competitiveness

-   Capacity to innovate and compete with the rest of the world

-   1992: Indian export increased 13 times while Pak only doubles

-   Vietnam : 15 B USD in 2001 and 220 B USD in 2018

-   Export per capital India increased by 6.8 times while BD by 6.2 as compared to Pakistan

    -   Uncompetitiveness as compared to neighboring countries

-   Export : dynamism, technology absorption and adaptation, building reputation, brand names

-   Sports, textile, surgical: no branding

-   No MNCs developed

-   

    ## Reasons: Mangerial skills, organizational skills

> # .orange\[A survey quoted by .pink\[*The Economist*\] magazine (Feb 8th, 2021) of the Indian economy stated that a billion dollars of export growth in industry leads to the employment of 400,000 workers.\]

### Whether correct or not, but its obvious export leads to huge employment. Pakistan export is labour intensive, so increase in export will lead to increase in employment.

### ER4export, China

??? More than fixed exchange rate, intelligent management is needed. China is a case in point which kept ER continuously undervalued and dominated international export market.

### World Bank Report on Reviving Pakistan Exports

#### Senior economist WB rightly points out: 

>####     The long term decline in exports as a share of GDP has implications for thecountry's -foreign exchange-, -jobs- and -productivity growth-. Therefore,      confronting core challenges that are necessary for Pakistan to compete in the      global market is an imperative for sustainable growth. 

### The recomendations includes: 

####  1. gradually reduce the real effective rates of protection through a long-term tariff rationalisation strategy to encourage exports. 
####  2. reallocate export financing away from working capital and into capacity exapnsion through the Long-Term Financing Facility. 
####  3. Consolidate market intelligence services by supporting new exporters and evaluating the impact of current inteventions to increase their effectiveness; and 
####  4. Design and implement a long-term strategy to upgrade productivity of firms that fosters competition, innovation and maximises export potential.

class: top left \## The elite illusions and delusions

### The conclusions from the foregoing data and argument are as follows:

#### 1. Pakistan has to learn to live within its means;

#### 2. the country's obsession with imported cars (and other foreign consumer goods) is unaffordable as well as unsustainable;

#### 3. elitist policymakers would do well to study the development path and policies of successful peer countries; and,

#### 4. the country's free-riding elites have to be made to carry their share of responsibility.

## Budget issues

### Budget deficit : Rs.4900 billion (9% of GDP)

### Target deficit : Rs.3450 billion (6.3%)

Almost Rs.1500 to Rs.1600 billion deficit, one of the largest in hisotry We are at the limits of our solvency \### Reasons Unrealistic budget outlays: increase demand which leads to mushroom growth \### IMF will closely watch shape of the budget Why this huge budge deficit : Oil prices led to fall in revenue from PL

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Proposals

### 1.Reduce import

-   Increase tariff on agriculture products , we have opened too much of our economy

-   Zero cotton duty and agri products 15 to 30% , while India upto 60% 3 types of items

-   food items

-   medicines

-   fuel \### 1. Progressive income tax

-   maximum income tax bracket : India 10 times that of per capita GDP

-   

                                 Bangladesh 8 times

-   

                                 Pakistan 300 times

    Reduce it 20 million from Rs.75 million Tax on consolidated income not in piecemeal

-   Captial Gains Tax : 0 after plot is sold after 3 years \### 1. Increase Oil prices

### SDD resistance from banks

Rs.1400 billion interest income by top 10 banks which is - 60% of total domestic debt - 11% more than defence expenditure - 26% of total tax revenue - 3% of GDP **FAIR** *Banks refund some of their excess profits from the debt crisis*

#### How much SDD works

Cyprus: 2013=15 haircuts of 36% more achieved Greence : 2012 SDD and SFD 65-78%

??? If former, go for more loan If not sustainable, then restructing/rescheduling Pakistan debt is so large that servicing it is reducing investment and adversely affecting incentives to invest, reducing economic growth and ultimately future debt serving capacity. Govt should go domestic debt solvency only (SDD), why? limited impact on external reputation, and access to external debt market

### How to come out of vicious cycle?

> WB Oct,2021 Review: "Pakistan Development Update: Reviving exports 1. reduce effective protection (gradually) through a long term tariff rationalization: ex-PM IK does exactly the opposite: gave more incentives to investors barring few subsectors. 2. Reallocate export financing away from working capital into capacity expansion through long term financing facility. 3. New exporters and evaluate impact of current interventions to increase their effectiveness. Admn after admn, standard normal instruments without doing any empirical study on their effectiveness which way partyly be due to same faces heading ministers from one admn to another Result: most influential industries survives in export/industrial sector 4. Design and implement a long term strategy to upgrade productivity of firms that foster expectation, innovation and maximizes export potential

Moreover, slash the need to borrow for budgetary support for which reduce expenditure

10+ party coalition IMF : 7th review 3 billion dollars, other bilateral will also help

New government has increased energy prices and have made commitment to IMF for increase in fuel prices which is a step in *Good housekeeping*

PSDP has already been cut by Rs.200 to Rs.600/(billions) Contractionary monetary policy implies reduction in growth rate, low tax revenue Renegotiate with IMF: Little mild conditions will help for other bilateral agencies

## Solution
Macro policy , macroprudential regulations
ER (flexible), Future stance, Reserves
Capital account judicious use
Narrow definition of sectors, not speculative investment, 
Capital flight
Manage capital account carefully
- Remittance : 10% of the GDP, higher than India, BD, because domestic market not able to generate jobs
-Spare a fraction of remittance on annual basis

-BOP: Energy crisis, local solar plant
-Taxation of land: capital gain tax and spend it in urban infrastructure and developmenti in cities

Go to IMF and monitor the following indicators: 
GDP growth not an only indicator but also include
- Debt to GDP ratio
- Revenue to GDP
- Budget deficit 
- Inflation

### Economy: set of ind and groups decisions

#### Bottom-up, Top-down, mix or some other: vary

#### Economy: Productivity, products, activity, trade and exchange, transaction among many others

#### Even well motivated plans to send children to schools failed

#### Parents decisions more complex than donors assume

#### Development not uniform across the countries

#### Local issues, cultures & community, social and human capital plays a critical role

#### Planners try their best even out these difficult often at huge cost with very little success

 - Complexities of the 21st Century

 - Energy: Lack of professional regularity capacity

## Getting the basics right

-   Economy is not rocket science
-   Qs" What are the basics?
-   Basics: high revenue, high export, high growth, low dollar rupee ER etc with low inflation
-   WOW: Simple and easy : Economy is not rocket science
-   Wishing all good things is economics and economist is supposed to help governments to do all these good things with magic stick
-   5-Year plans for all Basics

## One Opinion
- Securing property rights 
 - Strengthening contracting 
 - Reducing transaction costs 
 - Reducing and reforming markets for efficiency 
 - Removing incentives for rent seeking and putting incentives for entrepreneurship 
   - For Example : W/o good governance: no wish list will happen as plan after plan failed due to poor governance

## Get the growth model

-   Export led policies help China, SK and others
-   Special Economic Zones
-   Digitization (Inequality)
-   Reverse Myopia Build the capacity to play long game where decisions 20 years from now -\> Long game: who we are as a nation? -\> Where we want to go?

## Boosting Domestic Productivity

> Boosting domestic productivity which means raising the capacities and capabilities of your people - Our focus : Ask US to do this, ask China for Gawadar/CPEC - Not focusing on building domestic institutions, improving domestic capacity - Why don't governments focus - One needs hard work, local thinking, building teams, build institutions - Hire right competent people - no to nepotism - Easy not to do any of that

## Short-termism: MYOPIC APPROACH

-   Successive governments suffering from myopia
-   Occasional consumption booms from borrowing and remittances (2002-05), 2016-18
-   Increased informal economy weakening state control and governace besides erosion of tax-base
-   Pakistan remained married to begging bowl
-   Sought FDI without terms
-   Pipenomics : Someone build for us
-   Poor aid governance led to poor aid practices \> This distracts one not to think hard

---
## Extractive economic institutions
  - Lack of law and order 
  - Insecure property rights 
  - Entry barriers and regulation that prevented functioning of markets and created a un-leveled playing field 
  - System designed by and for the benefit of the elite 
  
## Inclusive economic institutions
 - Secure property rights
 - Law and order
 - Markets and state support (public services and regulations) for markets
 - Free entry of new businesses
 - Contract enforcement
 - Access to education and opportunity for the great majority of citizens

## What to do ?

-   Pakistan's economic and export problems are deep and structural

-   Focusing on fixing twin deficit (CAD & FD) is misplaced and is important for the time being. Addressing symptoms will not cure the disease

-   Build up domestic capacity to innovate, to organize and to manage - An Economist Job: not to tell what to do and what not

-   But tell cost of doing business as usual vs develop your software and progress

-   Talent will not stay

-   Production over Commerce

-   Our full focus on meeting dollar demand is misplaced

## [The exchange rate challenge](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40172209/the-exchange-rate-challenge)

### Growth can come through improving exports in industry, agriculture and services.

### Exchange rate: Policy instrument

-   

    #### Price stability through overrated ER or

-   

    #### market based value?

    ??? Price stability for short run by injecting USD into market, not sustainable (neither enough reserves nor can be done for long) Export becomes uncompetitive Overvalued ER: only for textile where import is major component But loss of reserves False pride in overvalued rupees RER= supply and demand are in balance. To put simply, the value of exports and the sum of immigrant remittances must be about the same as the import, the expense our foreign travels, plus payment against foreign investments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## .orange\[Exchange rate is considered in Pakistan as a barometer of pride. The higher the value of Pak Rs., higher our self-esteem. In practice, overvalued exchange rate helps in having stable price level in the short run, if one has enough reserves which unfrotunately we dont have. But its damage in terms of becoming uncompetitive far outweighs its benefits of price stability\]

## [Rupees Overevaluation: Asad Zaman](https://www.dawn.com/news/1483223/rupee-overvaluation)

### Rs. overvaluation: only if govt sells dollars in market

### OVRs: subsidy across all import, $100 for 90$

### Detrimental to domestic industry

### Beneficial to import: oil czars will import

---
class: center middle inverse

# Why have we pursued a policy of mass subsidy for all imports?
## The domestic economy will never learn to produce if it is cheaper to import goods at prices subsidised by government borrowing.
---

### .pull-left\[Our oil czars import oilseeds from Brazil and Malaysia, since it costs more to grow our own sunflowers! \]

## \### .pull-right\[Attempts at producing export-oriented silk, olive oil, palm oil, small electronics, and other light industrial products, have all faltered because overvaluation makes it extremely difficult to produce competitive products.\]

## .orange.pull-left\[Pakistani efforts have failed because overvaluation makes imports cheap. China, Japan and East Asian countries followed the opposite policy of undervaluation to industrialise.\]

## .orange.pull-right\[The question is why, when it is so harmful for local development, have we pursued a policy of mass subsidy for all imports over decades. Billions of dollars in subsidies goes to select industries which profit immensely from cheaper-than-market-value imports. \]
