What do we mean by public spaces here? For whom we are talking about public spaces? Is it youth aged, working population, women, students Civic outlook Place to relax to enjoy? What is concret in the proposal? NY and New Zealand : What single or two public spaces one is talking?

Its too broad in scope and how will all this be achieved in one proposal.

What do we mean by street economy? Karachi company, Jinnah Super F-7, Liberty Lahore...

Objectives : How will these be achieved?

Melody and Aabpara:

Not central locations

Choice of location is not good from footfall point of view

Immediate jump to affectees

What kind of regeneration

I fear upper portions will remain vacant unless its something for elite or investment

What are the benefits to people

Cities are for people,

What income group you have in mind?

**Legal FW should be main concern**

Make it attractive to live, make it people friendly

Reimagine the whole space

Who will implement?

Its not a research

One side by office buildings, other is green belt-stadium and other side is

It is not relevant to the scope

Does it mean that a poor guy should die in rural area because Gilgit city has

less opportunities?

## DDR.CR-011

Sustainable Development Through Urban Regeneration

Health care facilities are very important

So Is question is how our hospitals enable paradmedics and doctors to deal with patients in pandemics.

Lot of talk on diseases

How will help urban regeneration

### Objectives

Reimagining health care facilities

Redesigning of Railway Hospital : Health care tourism site

How?

Public private partnership is there?

Is this railway hospital not already in public private partnership program? Probably Riphah University has contract with Railway. So please correct me (either PI or Co-PI)

Too wide

Health care documentation

Environment design interventions

More on rhetoric than concrete objective and methodology

Hospitals : Business plan
