## Introduction

This document brings together two key areas: understanding the challenges of data sharing and exploring how emerging technologies like Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) can help overcome these challenges. By considering the interplay between organizational, technological, legal, and data-focused barriers, and by leveraging Gen AI and LLMs for improvements in data management, code translation, and stakeholder engagement, we can move towards more efficient, transparent, and beneficial data ecosystems.

## Why Data Sharing is Hard (and How to Make it Easier)

### Technology

**Why it’s hard:**
  - Bespoke, siloed IT systems  
- Legacy IT making data hard to extract  
- Outsourced IT providers charging for data access  
- Lack of a common platform for data sharing

**How to make it easier:**
  - Use technology conforming to common standards for interoperability  
- Insist all IT has open APIs  
- Ensure contracts give full access to data  
- Invest in a common platform for data sharing

### Data

**Why it’s hard:**
  - Data in hard-to-use formats (e.g., PDFs)  
- Inconsistent data entry practices  
- Use of different standards  
- Lack of common identifiers  
- Limited open data availability

**How to make it easier:**
  - Record all data in machine-readable formats  
- Enforce consistent data entry  
- Adopt common standards  
- Implement unique IDs (e.g., UPRNs)  
- Release non-personal data openly by default

### Legal

**Why it’s hard:**
  - Risk-averse leadership  
- Staff unsure about data protection rules  
- Senior data role limited to Data Protection Officer (DPO)  
- Lack of template data sharing agreements

**How to make it easier:**
  - Train all staff in Privacy Impact Assessments  
- Appoint a Chief Data Officer focused on responsible data sharing  
- Utilize template Information Sharing Protocols

### Organisation

**Why it’s hard:**
  - Teams siloed by remit  
- Limited dedicated time and resources for data collaboration  
- Leaders lack understanding of the role and potential use of data

**How to make it easier:**
  - Establish Offices of Data Analytics  
- Dedicate in-house analysts’ time to data science projects rather than just KPI reporting  
- Encourage leadership to use data-informed decision-making

## Exploring the Potential of Gen AI and LLMs

Recent advancements in Gen AI and LLMs open up new avenues for addressing these data challenges:
  
  - **Exploring potential of Gen AI and LLM models:** Identifying tasks that can be automated, optimized, or enhanced by advanced language models.
- **Digitisation of documents:** Converting large volumes of analog or PDF-based information into machine-readable formats suitable for analysis and model training.
- **Human capital in LLMs, Gen AI:** Building staff capabilities around using and understanding LLMs and Gen AI tools, ensuring organizations can fully leverage these technologies.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting effective prompts to guide LLM behavior, improving outputs for data extraction, code generation, and problem-solving.
- **Real-time data:** Leveraging LLMs for continuous monitoring and rapid interpretation of streaming data sources.

### Example Use Cases

- **GPT-like models (e.g., StatGPT, ImpactAI by IMF and WB):** Using domain-specific LLMs to assist in statistical analysis, impact assessments, and more.
- **Gen AI for coding:** Translating code between languages (e.g., SPSS/Stata to R/Python), accelerating data preparation and analysis.
- **ML and AI for linking datasets:** Survey-to-survey, census-to-survey, and administrative data-to-survey integration, enabling richer analysis and insights.

## Using Gen AI and LLMs for Improvements

**LLMs can help with:**
  - **Code Translation:** Convert code from one statistical package to another to streamline workflows.
- **Standardization:** Harmonize data formats, variable names, and coding conventions.
- **Code Simplification:** Reduce complexity, making codebases more readable and maintainable.
- **Efficiency Gains:** Automate repetitive tasks, speed up data cleaning, and improve turnaround times.

Beyond technical tasks:
  - **Managerial and Operational Support:** LLMs can assist in reporting, decision-making, and disseminating insights across the organization.

## Resources and Infrastructure

To fully harness these capabilities, organizations need appropriate infrastructure and protocols:
  
  - **GPUs:** Compute resources for training and running LLMs efficiently.
- **Cloud Storage:** Scalable storage solutions for large datasets.
- **Data Protocols for Administrative Records and Social Media:** Standards for extracting, cleaning, and using varied data sources.
- **Improving Standardized Processes:** Enhanced workflows for analyzing administrative records ensure consistent, comparable outputs.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Facilitating fluent conversation with stakeholders and data users through AI-driven interfaces.
- **Public Consultations and Dissemination:** Using AI tools to produce accessible summaries, visualizations, and reports for the public.
- **Automation of Tasks:** Streamlining data ingestion, integration, and reporting pipelines.

## LLMs Chatbots and User Interfaces

User-facing LLM-based tools can support a wide range of activities:
  
  - **Browsing Functionalities:** Integrating LLMs with external knowledge bases.
- **Training Data on LLMs:** Continuously refining models with curated datasets.
- **Training Materials:** Providing instant access to documentation and educational content.
- **Digital Maps:** Geospatial data integration and on-demand mapping.
- **Access to Tools:** Seamless connection to statistical software, visualization libraries, and APIs.
- **Better Dissemination:** Improved communication of complex findings to various audiences.
- **Manuals Digitization:** Converting thousands of pages of manuals into searchable, model-friendly formats.
- **Hub of Data:** Creating centralized data repositories accessible through natural language interfaces.

## Conclusion

Bridging the gap between data challenges and organizational goals involves not only establishing robust data governance frameworks but also embracing new technologies like Gen AI and LLMs. By digitizing information, adopting common standards, training staff in data protection and privacy, and using AI-driven tools for data management, organizations can improve efficiency, consistency, and the overall value they derive from their data.
